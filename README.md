# Software-for-Hardware-Interfacing

This is a chapter in my journey through the embedded systems track. Here you can find my own implementations and solutions for the tasks that I had in college that include:

 - C programming exercises (first two labs and first task)
 -  Interfacing with STM32F401CC microcontroller

 These might be not the perfect solutions, but at least you can see the progress that I made as I was learning.
